💡 IMPORTANT REMINDERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ADD YOUR LOGO:
   The site expects a logo at: assets/img/fixitqc-logo.png
   Without it, you'll see a broken image on the nav bar.
   Recommended size: ~300x60px PNG

2. DEMO MODE:
   Admin panel works WITHOUT Firebase setup!
   Perfect for testing before going live.
   All data stored in browser memory.

3. OPTIONAL SCREENSHOTS:
   Add screen1.png through screen6.png in assets/img/
   Or remove the screenshots page if not needed.

4. FIREBASE DEPLOYMENT:
   Already configured for: fixit-prod-71fcb
   Just run: firebase deploy --only hosting
